# C++ library to parse NMEA GPS data

C++ parser builds objects from NMEA data strings.  
Currently supports NMEA 3.1  

goals:
- NMEA lib code does not need to know what the target microcontroller is.
- NMEA lib does not depend on your communication layer or GPS driver, as long as it serves data in NMEA format.
